# M7-Holiday-Assess

Program to scrape data regarding holidays from https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/ and 
weather data from https://community-open-weather-map.p.rapidapi.com/forecast

Can be run from a cli and runs everything in it

Further includes options to add and remove holidays and to save to json from the repository of 2700+ holidays spanning the years 2020-2024 in the US

Repo itself contains other extraneous reference files, the only strictly necessary ones are holiday_startercode.py and holidays.json, and can be run with the command 

python holiday_startercode.py

from any terminal where these 2 files are in the same folder location.

May also require installations of bs4 and requests which can be found online
